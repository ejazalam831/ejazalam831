🚀 From crunching numbers to training algorithms, my journey into data science has been driven by a fascination with turning complex data into meaningful insights.

🎓 Recently completed my Master's in Applied Data Science from University of Michigan, where I developed a passion for building scalable ML solutions.

🔭 I believe the best data science solutions come from understanding both the business context and technical implementation. My background in finance gives me a unique perspective on how to create impactful AI solutions.

💻 Currently exploring:
- Data-driven solutions that bridge business and technology
- Writing articles that make complex ML concepts accessible to everyone 📝

🌱 I'm always interested in:
- Collaborating on ML/AI projects
- Business process optimization through AI
- Sharing knowledge and learning from others
